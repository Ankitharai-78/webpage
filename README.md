<p>I'm a magical item that moves people or freight between floors, levels, or decks of a building, vessel, or other structure. I'm typically powered by electric motors that drive traction cables and counterweight systems such as a hoist, although some pump hydraulic fluid to raise a cylindrical piston like a jack.</p>
